    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <div id="terms-content">
        <p><strong>1. Pre-Sale Veterinary Care:</strong> All puppies sold by Boykin’s Finest Kennels (“Seller”) are dewormed, receive their first vaccination, and have tails docked and dewclaws removed by a licensed veterinarian prior to sale, in accordance with South Carolina veterinary standards and Boykin Spaniel Society (BSS) guidelines for the breed, with no exceptions. Veterinary records are provided to the Purchaser at pickup.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Mandatory Wellness Check:</strong> Purchaser must arrange a complete wellness examination by a licensed veterinarian within four (4) days of puppy pickup. A detailed report must be emailed to <a href="mailto:boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com">boykinsfinestkennels@gmail.com</a> within three (3) days of purchase. Failure to comply voids the health assurance and all associated warranties.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Non-Refundable Deposit:</strong> A non-refundable deposit of thirty percent (30%) of the total purchase price is required to reserve a puppy. This deposit is binding upon receipt by Seller and non-refundable under any circumstances, including Purchaser cancellation or failure to complete the purchase.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Breeding Restrictions:</strong> Purchaser agrees not to breed BSS-registered puppies without prior written consent from Seller and confirmation of compliance with BSS health and registration standards. Violation incurs a $5,000 penalty, forfeiture of ownership rights, and return of the puppy to Seller at Purchaser’s expense.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Minimum Age for Puppy Sales:</strong> Seller complies with South Carolina law (SC Code Ann. § 47-13-30), prohibiting the sale of puppies under eight (8) weeks of age to ensure proper development and socialization.</p>
        <p><strong>6. Return Policy for Care Concerns:</strong> If Purchaser cannot provide adequate care (as determined solely by Seller), the puppy or adult dog must be returned to Seller’s South Carolina facility at Purchaser’s expense. Non-compliance may result in legal action, with Purchaser liable for all costs.</p>
        <p><strong>7. Health Assurance:</strong> Seller provides a six-month assurance against hereditary diseases, effective from the date of purchase, contingent upon compliance with Section 2. Claims must be validated by a licensed veterinarian and a report sent to Seller within twenty-four (24) hours of discovery. Seller offers no refunds or replacement options unless the puppy is returned to Seller within three (3) days due to a health defect, in which case Purchaser may receive a partial refund, minus the deposit, at Seller’s discretion. This assurance constitutes Seller’s sole liability.</p>
        <p><strong>8. BSS Health Testing Compliance:</strong> Seller’s breeding stock adheres to BSS requirements, including hip and elbow evaluations (OFA or PennHIP), eye examinations (CERF or OFA), and cardiac screening (OFA), conducted by qualified veterinarians prior to breeding.</p>
        <p><strong>9. BSS Registration:</strong> Puppies sold as BSS-registered are provided with registration papers at pickup, subject to Purchaser maintaining BSS membership and adhering to the BSS Code of Ethics, prohibiting cross-breeding with other breeds or unregistered Boykin Spaniels.</p>
        <p><strong>10. South Carolina Animal Welfare Compliance:</strong> Seller operates in full compliance with SC Code Ann. § 47-1-40, ensuring humane treatment, sanitary conditions, and adequate resources, subject to inspection by South Carolina authorities.</p>
        <p><strong>11. Limitation on Overbreeding:</strong> Per BSS standards and South Carolina welfare laws, Seller restricts female Boykin Spaniels to a maximum of five (5) litters in their lifetime, with at least twelve (12) months between litters.</p>
        <p><strong>12. Purchaser Responsibility for Licensing:</strong> Purchaser must obtain and maintain all required local or state animal licenses within thirty (30) days of pickup, per SC Code Ann. § 47-3-20, and provide proof to Seller upon request.</p>
        <p><strong>13. Limitation of Liability:</strong> Seller is not responsible for veterinary costs, emotional distress, or incidental damages beyond the health assurance in Section 7. Purchaser assumes all risks post-pickup, including accidents, illness, or loss.</p>
        <p><strong>14. Governing Law:</strong> This agreement is governed by the laws of South Carolina. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of Horry County, South Carolina.</p>
